description: By G.K. Chesterton The Ballad of the White Horse is one of the last great
  epic poems in the English language. On the one hand it describes King Alfred's battle
  against the Danes in 878. On the other hand it is a timeless allegory about the
  ongoing battle between Christianity and the forces of nihilistic heathenism. Filled
  with colorful characters, thrilling battles and mystical visions, it is as lively
  as it is profound. Chesterton incorporates brilliant imagination, atmosphere, moral
  concern, chronological continuity, wisdom and fancy. He makes his stanzas reverberate
  with sound.
